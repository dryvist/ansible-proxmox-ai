"""The kanban goal loop, VERBATIM from the pinned upstream release.

Its own file because it is large and because it must stay byte-exact: this is
the source two role patches anchor into AND the control flow the cron
goal-mode adapter has to satisfy.

NOT a paraphrase, and never again a reduction. The previous copy here was a
hand-reduced skeleton that dropped the `status == "blocked"` branch and fed
`run_turn` a literal `"continue"` instead of the real finalize template. Both
omissions were invisible to every test, and they hid a real defect: the cron
adapter passed a `task_status_fn` returning None, which this function treats
as archived and returns `stopped` on — so `judge_goal` was never reached and
the auxiliary judge produced no traffic at all. A reduction cannot prove an
adapter satisfies a contract it does not fully reproduce.

Refresh with scripts/verify-pinned-patches.py when hermes_agent_version moves.
